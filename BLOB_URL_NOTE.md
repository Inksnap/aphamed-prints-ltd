Products blob URL for Vercel

Add the following environment variable in Vercel Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

- Key: PRODUCTS_BLOB_URL
- Value: https://z8ghuftbbdhvyrjf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/products.json

After adding the env var, redeploy the project (push or Vercel UI). This commit is a small redeploy trigger.
